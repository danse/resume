    .section
      .title introducing myself
      .content.
        I am a developer passionate about free software, data
        visualisation and functional programming
    .section
      .title experience
      .content.
        I studied computer science thoroughly during my years of
        university. I worked as back end developer on a transaction
        infrastructure, as frond end developer specialised in data
        visualisation, and as a full stack developer building a whole
        application from the wireframes to the services
    .section
      .title work methodology
      .content.
        I am a fan of test driven development. This methodology
        offered me surprising results both in a backend as well as in
        a front end environment. I also care a lot for free software. I
        think that normally it would be smart for a company to keep
        closed just a small part of its code, as working on free
        software improves many aspects of the development
        process. Lastly, i love simple solutions, oriented by
        the user needs
